WHAT IT DOES?
=============

Adds (optional) OMS support on LineageOS14.1

HOW TO USE IT?
==============

Needs to be patched directly after fresh LineageOS14.1 repo sync
Patches needs to stay here: $REPO/device/CUBOT/NOTE_S/patches/oms
now start patches: 
1. cd device/CUBOT/NOTE_S/patches/oms
2. bash apply-oms.sh

Notice
==============
OMS for LineageOS14.1 is outdated and not all Themes are supported up to 100%
Some themes can have some issues, so you need to try it out if they're work.
